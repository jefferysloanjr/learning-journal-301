##### Learning Journal 7
###### **Jeffery Sloan**

Today we went into more detail about the server.js. Still a lot to figure out but with time it should become more easy. I am slowly figuring all of this new information out and working with another helps a bit. I feel I learning at a slower pace than most in 301. Some of the topics we have covered are really difficult and I hope projects this week go well.
