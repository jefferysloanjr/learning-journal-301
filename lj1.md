##### Learning Journal Day 1
###### **Jeffery Sloan**

Today was nice to be back and learning. I had fun with pair programming and completing code wars. I feel much better abour 301 then I did 201. I was very stressful and I feel more confident. I learned about jQuery methods and how to apply them and using HTML selectors in jQuery. I look forward to learn more.
