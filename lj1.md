It has been a difficult few days but yesterday while in lecture, doing some debugging definitely clarified some difficulties I was struggling with. I like that we do that and i hope we continue to. Some of the thing we learn just doesn't stick with me. I am learning but I feel as a slower pace than others. I like having the partner project like this. It has helped to get a handle on some of the things i have missed.
