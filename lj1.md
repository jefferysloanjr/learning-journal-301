Late in the week we learned regex which was fun to just play around with. I am trying to get a grasp on using handlebars. With having afternoon lecture it is a bit difficult with my commute time but I am managing. It has taken some time to adjust too. Working in pairs is very helpful, getting a different view from someone else. I am enjoying my time there and look forward to continue to learn more.
