Today using node.js and express seemed a bit easier than I thought it would. It did take some time to complete but it did not seem that difficult at this moment. While in class we learned about SQL and I need to wrap my head around that. Tomorrows lab I hope i get a handle on it and understand it. I am slowly getting an idea of how it should look. Hopefully it all will soon click. I like going back to watch lecture videos to get a better understanding on how everything works.
