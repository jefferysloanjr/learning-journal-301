Learning for me this course I feel has become somewhat difficult. I am not retaining the information as well. The commute I have definitely has played a part this course. I am looking forward to working on a project with someone. I think it can be beneficial to me to get another way to learn on a one on one level. Staying positive for the rest of this course.
