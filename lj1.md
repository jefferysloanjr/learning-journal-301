Today we have gotten and intro to JSON and AJAX. Its definitely going to take a bit of time to understand. Everything is coming quickly and i do not wish to fall behind. Although, I am enjoying working with everyone, I feel a lot others have a better knowledge of understand how the code works. I have a problem getting started. I am looking forward to working with my partner tomorrow to learn and get a different perspective.
